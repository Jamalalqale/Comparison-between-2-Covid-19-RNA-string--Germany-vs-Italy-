## Description 
- The data collected on Aug 2020.
- The project is about comparison between two RNA string of Covid-19 (Italy and Germany).
- We first compare each RNA string with the Origin RNA string (China) to find out if there is any mutation occurred ,then we compare the RNA strings gathered from Italy with the RNA strings gathered from  German to find out if there is any difference between them. 






# Results



According to a study Posted May 20, 2020 on biorxiv website(operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a not-for-profit research and educational institution in USA), researchers identified mutations in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may have contributed to its dominance in Europe and elsewhere.

The results suggest that one mutation in particular – 14408C>T – (RdRP)is involved in increasing the mutation rate and possibly the transmissibility of the virus, And it has been identified in more than 7000 isolates from various continents One early study of SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from North America and Europe suggested that 14408C>T is associated with a higher number of mutations, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood.

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRP) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA-containing viruses. It's responsible for catalyzing the replication of RNA from an RNA template.

Interestingly the authors describe two other mutations that co-evolved with 14408C>T, namely 23403A>G and 3037C>T. These two mutaions appeared in both Italian and German samples in this project

They examined the relationships of the RdRp mutations with mutations found in M or E proteins (hereafter referred to as MoE).

The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV formation depends on either M and E proteins or M and N proteins.
